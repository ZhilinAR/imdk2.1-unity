# Immersal SDK Core 
This is the core package for the Immersal Unity SDK.

# Compatibility

- Unity 2022.3 LTS
- AR Foundation 5.1+
- OpenXR 1.8.2+
- XREAL NRSDK 1.7.0+

Note: Earlier versions of Unity and AR Foundation will still work with minimal script changes.

# Installation steps

To install the latest available version:
1. Copy the URL to this repository:
```
https://github.com/immersal/imdk-unity.git
```
2. Go to the Package Manager in Unity.
3. Open the add menu in the toolbar.
4. Select "Add package from git URL".
5. Paste the copied URL and click Add.

This package depends on the official XREAL NRSDK. Unity's Package Manager should download `com.xreal.nrsdk` automatically, but ensure your project has access to the XREAL registry or install the package manually if needed.

Please visit our [Developer Documentation](https://developers.immersal.com/docs/ "SDK Documentation") for more detailed instructions as to how to use the SDK.
